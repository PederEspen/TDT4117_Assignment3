# TDT4117_Assignment3

This assignment was done in cooperation with Eskild Brobak (eskildbr@stud.ntnu.no).

For the most part the assignment was alright, had to get quite alot of help from TAs on certain parts though. A pretty substantial assignment, but was quite fun and nice to get some practical use out of what we learned so far. There are some comments in the code, though its mostly taken from the assignment sheet or is otherwise pretty standard.
